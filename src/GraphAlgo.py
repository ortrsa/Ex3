        this method based on 4 data structure path(list) , unused(PriorityQueue), used(list)
        and nodePar(dict).
        first add the src node to unused PriorityQueue and set is weight to 0,

        replace the node weight with his father + the edge between the node and his father.
        (skip this step for the father node).
        add to unused PriorityQueue  , same for all neighbors.
        after that pull the next node from unused, because of the PriorityQueue every next node on the list
        will be with the lightest weight.
        after iterate throw all the graph all the nodes will be in the nodeDis Hashmap and contain in the value
        their min weight from src node.
        also the nodePar will contain every node and his father when called from shortestPath method.
        now that nodePar is full we can go from the dest node by pointer back until well get to the
        src node while we adding the nodes the pointer points on to a list which will be the shortest path list
