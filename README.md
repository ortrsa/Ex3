# Ex3

## Overview 
- This project is an implementation of data structures and algorithms on directional weighted graph in python.    
- It is converthion from Ex2 that was made at java, you can find more abut Ex2 in [Here](https://github.com/ortrsa/ex2).
- This is a text base program however you can still drow the graph with `plot_graph()` method. 
- This project was build from 3 parts:    

**part1:** imploment basic directional weighted graph class `DiGraph` that contains simpale functions on graph.

**part2:** imploment `GraphAlgo` class, that contains more advanced functions on graph.      

*(you can find all the relevant functions in this [WikiPage](https://github.com/ortrsa/Ex3/wiki/Inherent-diagram).)*  
**part3:** compare runing time and correctness between this project, [Ex2](https://github.com/ortrsa/ex2)  and [networkx](https://github.com/networkx/networkx).  

  - To see time compareition on circal graphs click **[here](https://github.com/ortrsa/ex2)**.
  - To see time compareition on random graphs click **[here](https://github.com/ortrsa/ex2)**.
  - For correctness report outputs click **[here](https://github.com/ortrsa/ex2)**
  - *(you can find the correctness file in the src folder feel free to verified this output)*

  
# How To Run
 
first clone the repo:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ortrsa/Ex3.git

```
than you can load graph from JSON file with `load_from_json("your_file_name")`,  
or create your own graph like this:  
```sh
my_DiG = DiGraph()

my_DiG.add_node(1)
my_DiG.add_node(2)
         .
         .
         .
         .
         .       edge weight
         .           |
                     V
my_DiG.add_edge(1,2,14)
my_DiG.add_edge(2,1,16)
         .
         .
         .
my_G = GraphAlgo(my_DiG)

"
put your code here....
"
        
```
Then you can apply on the graph any function from GraphAlgo,   
You can read all about the functions in [here](https://github.com/ortrsa/Ex3/wiki/Functions-explanation).


# How it's work..
After initing the graph, the fun part begins,  
In GraphAlgo we implement advenced functhion with some familiar algorithms like BFS, and dijkstra's.  
`shorest_path()` - use [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) to find the shortest path In the most efficient way.  
**Dijkstra's**

`connected_component()` - make 2 list, list 1 contain all the nodes that you can get *from* the first node, and list 2 contain all the nodes that can get *to* the first node, and take the intersection between list 1 and 2.  
we abale to make this lists using [BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search).

`plot_graph()` - use [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html) library to drow the graph.
